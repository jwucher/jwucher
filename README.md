- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwucher
- 👀 I’m interested in everything :).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be more patient.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whirled peas.
- 📫 How to reach me ... with donuts!

Once upon a time, I dreamed in code and wrote stuff for games.  The rivers of thoughts flowed and overflowed and the fruits were wonderous...in my mind :).
Some of those can be found here (under my old company):  https://github.com/NonlinearIdeas.
